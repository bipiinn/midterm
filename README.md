Step 3: Create routes for CRUD operations

Create a new directory named routes in your project directory.
Inside the routes directory, create a new file named students.js.
Define routes for CRUD operations in students.js.
Export the router.

Step 4: Connect routes to the Express app

Open app.js.
Import the student routes.
Connect the student routes to the Express app.


Step 5: Implement the logic for CRUD operations

Create a new directory named models in your project directory.
Inside the models directory, create a new file named student.model.js.
Define the schema for the student model using Mongoose.
Implement the logic for CRUD operations using the Mongoose model.

Step 6: Test the API
